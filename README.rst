Linux Integration Services Automation (LISA)
============================================

|CI Workflow| |GitHub license| |Docs|

**Linux Integration Services Automation (LISA)** is a Linux quality
validation system, which consists of two partsï¼š

-  A test framework to drive test execution.
-  A set of test suites to verify Linux kernel/distribution quality.

``LISA`` was originally designed and implemented for Microsoft Azure and
Windows HyperV platforms; now it can be used to validate Linux quality
on any platforms if the proper orchestrator module is implemented.

Why LISA
--------

-  **Scalable**: Benefit from the appropriate abstractions, ``LISA``
   can be used to test the quality of numerous Linux distributions
   without duplication of code implementation.

-  **Customizable**: The test suites created on top of ``LISA`` can be
   customized to support different quality validation needs.

-  **Support multiple platforms**: ``LISA`` is created with modular
   design, to support various of Linux platforms including Microsoft
   Azure, Windows HyperV, Linux bare metal, and other cloud based
   platforms.

-  **End-to-end**: ``LISA`` supports platform specific orchestrators to
   create and delete test environment automatically; it also provides
   flexibility to preserve environments for troubleshooting if test(s)
   fails.
